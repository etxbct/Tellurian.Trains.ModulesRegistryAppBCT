## Cargo Types Help
Only administrators can add new cargo types.
You can ask any administrator to help you with that.

The reason is that each new cargo type must have translations to all supported languages and be assigned a relevant NHM-code.
There should also be checked that no duplicates are added under different names.

NHM-codes are the international codes for different types of cargo used, and is defined by UIC, the *International Union of Raiways*.
