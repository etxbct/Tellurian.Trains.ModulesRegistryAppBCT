## Reasons for Not Authorised

### Login failed
For some reason your login failed. Primary reason is that you provided wrong user email and/or password.
You can also be locked out after your login failed three times.
For security reasons, no feedback of failed logins are indicated.

Login is comfirmed by presenting your name as logged in at top of the page.
If your name is not there, you will not have access.
Note that you must accept *cookies* from *moduleregistry.azurewebsites.net*, otherwise logging in will fail.
Usually, this is enabled by default, but sometimes cookies can be rejected.


### You are logged in
Even if you are logged in, 
you may sometimes find that you are **not authorised** to viev a page.
Here are some common reasons:

- **Terms of Use has not been accepted**.
You may have accepted them first time you logged in, 
but each time the *terms of use* are changed, 
you will be promted to approve them again. 
If you skip this, you will not have any access to your pages.

- **Page is not accessible for ordinary users**.
Some pages are accesible for administrators only.


**If you still have problems, don't hesistate to contact us.**
