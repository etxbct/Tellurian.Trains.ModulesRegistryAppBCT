## Reasons for Not Authorised
Even if you are logged in, 
you may sometimes find that you are **not authorised** to viev a page.
Here are some common reasons:

### Terms of Use has not been accepted
You may have accepted them first time you logged in, 
but each time the *terms of use* are changed, 
you will be promted to approve them again. 
If you skip this, you will not have any access to your pages.

### Login failed
For some reason your login failed.
Login is comfirmed by presenting your name as logged in at top of the page.
If your name is not there, you will not have access.
Note that you must accept *cookies* from *moduleregistry.azurewebsites.net*, otherwise logging in will fail.
Usually, this is enabled by default, but sometimes cookies can be rejected.

**If you still have problems, don't hesistate to contact us.**
