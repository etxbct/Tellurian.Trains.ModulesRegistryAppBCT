## Register Modules  Help
If there are several *layouts* planned for the meeting, you will get a choice to select one.

**Avaliable modules** are the *module packages* that are available but not (yet) registered for the layout.
The list is populated with *module packages* that have the same *scale* as the layout.
A *module package* contains modules with same *box label* or all *variants* of a module, so it can contain more than one module.

**Registered modules** are the modules you have registered for the *layout*.
You can witdraw modules up to the registration closes, as long as they are not assigned a *position* in the layout.
