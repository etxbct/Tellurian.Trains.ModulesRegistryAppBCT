## No waybills?
There can be several reasons why no waybills are displayed for printing for the station.
In order to print waybills, the follwoing criteria have to be fulfilled:
- The station must be connected to a country. This is done by assigning a *region* to the station.
- The station must have freight customers who send or receive goods that match other stations.
- The goods customers and / or the goods flow must be valid for at least one year of the meeting's time period, or that no time period has been specified.

If you have a station in the layout that is marked as 'shadow station', all station customers will get a waybill for each cargo type.

If you have an 'international' meeting with crossborder cargo flow, 
only cargo flows marked as *import* or *export* will match cargo customers at stations in another country.
