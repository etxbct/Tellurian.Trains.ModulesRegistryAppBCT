## Help External Station
> **NOTE**: **An external station must be entered with historically correct data
about the station and its customers.**
**The data is used in any cargo matching for your stations freight customers,
and incorrect data will wrongly match customers or cargo from different periods**.

- **Name** must be a name of a real station, current or historical.
- You can add an **Internaltional name** if the station's domestic name differs from international use, e.g. *Copenhagen/København*.
- **Signature** must be the correct short abbreviation for the station.
- **Opened year** must be the year when the station was opened for train operation. 
If this is before 1900 or you don't find any relevant data, leave it empty.
- **Closed year** is the year that trains were no longer served at the station.
Leave this empty if the station is still in operation.
