## Help Add Group Member
**NOTE**

**The purpose of a group is *any persons that want to administer data about modules collectively*. 
A group can also be a *meeting organiser*.
So you should only add people for those reasons.**

**A group is *not* a general club member register and must not be used for that pupose.**

#### Adding a member
- You can select a country to search for members to add. Initially it is the country of the group.
To change the country, find it in the list and then click OK.
- To search for a name, type at least three characters.
The search matches any part of the person's name.
- You can also see the people's names in the drop-down list.
- I you don't find a person, that could be due to two reasons: 
The person is already member, or the person does not exist in the database.
- You can add a person to the database only in your own country.
