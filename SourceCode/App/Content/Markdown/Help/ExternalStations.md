## Help External Stations
External stations are real stations that can ship or receive cargo.
You can use external stations for defining a matching customer that:
- Ships cargo types that your station customers receive, or
- Receive cargo types that your station customer ships.

Use external stations when you miss matchning freight suppliers or customers 
in the current layout, and want something historically correct on your waybills, 
rather that just a neutral shadow station region colour.

**NOTE**: **External stations should be entered with historically correct data
about the station and its customers, including relevant time periods for when the cargo was exchanged.**
**The data is used in any cargo matching for any meeting,
and incorrect data will wrongly match customers or cargo from different periods**.
