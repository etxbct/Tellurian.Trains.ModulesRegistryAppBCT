## Help - Layout
A *layout* is a complete set of tracks operated as one unit and separate from other layouts. 
Each layout should represent a *scale* and a *theme*.

> NOTE: Do *not* add several layouts for the same *scale* and *theme* if you intend to have operations that go across them.
The division of the layout into main and branch lines is done later when assigning modules to different lines.
