## Help - Layout
A *layout* is a complete set of tracks operated as one unit and separate from other layouts. 
Each layout should represent a *scale* and a *theme*.

> NOTE: Do *not* add several layouts for the same *scale* and *theme* if you intend to have operations that go across them.
The division of the layout into main and branch lines is done later when assigning modules to different lines.

- **Responsible Group** is not necessarily the same group that organises the overall meeting.
- **Contact Person** must be a member of the *responsible group*.
- **Theme**, **First**- and **Last Year** should describe the type and period of operation to run for the layout. These fields are optional.
- **Is Registration Permitted** should be checked if users of the Module Registry may register themselves and their modules.
This will enable the *Register* button for the layout. If any layout is permitted for registration, the meeting will also be.

> NOTE: You should always provide dates for when registration opens and closes.
> This is general information, regardless of how registration is made.

#### Fill in the Details
You can uses *markdown* to format content in the *details* field.
DO NOT use heading level 1 (single #), use ##, ### or ###.
