## Help - wiFRED throttles
This is how you enter data about your wiFRED throttle.

- **Owner** must be selected from the list. 
For normal users, the list only contains your name, 
wiFRED administrators can assign any person as owner. Note that the list only contains FREMO members.
- **MAC-address** is an unique physical address used to identfy the wiFRED in a network. 
You can find it in the wiFRED configuration page, see example below.
- **Name** is your the name to assign to your wiFRED.
You can find it in the wiFRED configuration page, see example below.
- **Inventory number** is part of your unique identification number for your wiFREDs. 
You can freely assign the number from 1 in ascending order. 
The identification number is then made up of your FREMO membership number + this inventory number.
This number can be used to create barcodes or QR codes, for example to easily program locomotives on wiFREDs.
- **DCC-sddresses 1-4** may be entered in advance to a meeting. 
When you register your wiFRED when you arrive to a meeting that permits QR-code registration, 
your wiFRED will automatically be configured with these DCC-adresses.
