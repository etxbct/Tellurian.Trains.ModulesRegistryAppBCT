## Help - wiFRED throttles
This is how you enter data about your wiFRED throttle.

- **Owner** must be selected from the list. 
For normal users, the list only contains your name, 
wiFRED administrators can assign any person as owner. Note that the list only contains FREMO members.
- **MAC-address** is an unique physical address used to identfy the wiFRED in a network. 
- **Name** is your given name to your wiFRED.
- **Inventory number** is your wiFRED number, starting at 1 and forwards.
The unique identity number of your wiFRED will be your FREMO member number + your inventory number, 
and you will be able to create a QR-code with this number to uniquely indenfify your wiFRED.
- **DCC-sddresses 1-4** may be entered in advance to a meeting. 
When you register your wiFRED when you arrive to a meeting that permits QR-code registration, 
your wiFRED will automatically be configured with these DCC-adresses.
