## Cargo Types Help
Only administrators can add new cargo types.
You can ask any administrator to help you with that.

The reason is that each new cargo type must have translations to all supported languages and be assigned a relevant NHM code.
It should also be checked that no duplicates are added under different names.

NHM codes are the international codes for different types of cargo used. 
Currently, the Module Registry uses only the four most significant digits of the 8-digit NMH-code.
They are defined by UIC, the *International Union of Railways*.
