## Help Regions
A *region* is a geographical part of a *country*. 
Stations are placed in *regions*. 

A *shadow station* can represent the external world for a layout 
by one or several *regions*.
When you have several shadow stations in a layout,
they usually represents different parts of a country,
and sometimes also all or parts of another country.

Cargo origin- or destination stations not present in a *layout*, 
will be sent from/to the shadow station that represents
the region where the  station is located.
A station not present in a layout can be of two types:
- A **module station** not present in the layout, but assigned to a *region*.
- A **real station**, defined as an *external station* with *freight customers*.
An external station always belongs to a *region*.
