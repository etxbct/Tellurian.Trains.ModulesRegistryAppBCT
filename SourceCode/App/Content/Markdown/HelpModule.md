## Module Help
> NOTE: A *module* is not automatically a *station*. In order to add *station tracks* and *freight customers* you need to make it a *station*.
> That *station* will be linked to your module.

Besides the more obvius fields in the form, some fields need some additional explanation:
- **Name** and **FREMO no.**
You can give your module any descriptive name, it does not have to be your *FREMO owner initials*+FREMO number.
The given FREMO number will instead be combined with your *FREMO owner initials* stored in your personal data, ensuring that the module's FREMO-id will be correct.
- **Variant** or **Box label** are mutually exclusive.
- **Variant** is used when a module can be assembled in different ways,
which requires you to enter each variant as *separate* modules with the *same* name
but with different characteristics and drawings. You enter a different *variant* for each, for example *short* and *long* module versions.
- **Box label** is used in any other case, and should be the identity of the box where the module is stored. If several modules are in the same box, they should have the same *box label*.
#### Visibility
You can control who can view your module and station data:
- **Private** means that only you and any *data administrator* in groups that you are a member of will be able to see your module/station.
- **Group members** means that *all members* of all groups that you are a member of will be able to see your module/station.
- **Domain members** means that *all members* of all groups you are a member of belonging to the same *domain* will be able to see your module/station.
- **All users** means that all logged-in users will be able to see your module/station.
>In all cases, only you and any *data administrator* in groups that you are a member of can modify data for your module/station. 
>When you submit a module to a meeting, the organising group's *data aministrator* can also modify data for your module/station. 
#### Exits
Each gable of a module represents an *exit*.
Most modules only have two *exits*, for example line-modules; you will have one in each direction: *east* and *west*.
When the track ends on the module, you add only one exit.

When specifying exits for *station modules* you must imagine that you stand at the operation place and have the module to the north of you.
Then *west* exits will be the ones to the *left* and the *east* exits will be the ones to the right.
You may have several *exits* in each direction.
These directions becomes extra important when you later specify *station track* directions.
