### Layouts
You can add any number of layouts.
A *layout* is a complete set of track separate from other layouts.  
Each layout should represent a *scale* and a *theme*.
Do *not* add several layouts for the same *scale* and *theme* if you intend to have operations that goes across them.
The division of the layout into main- and branch lines is made later when selecting modules into different lines.
