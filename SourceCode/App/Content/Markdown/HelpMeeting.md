## Meeting Help
A meeting is a single occasion with a start and an end date.

>NOTE: First and last dates to register modules is per layout.

### Layouts
You can add any number of layouts.
A *layout* is a complete set of tracks separate from other layouts.  
Each layout should represent a *scale* and a *theme*.

> NOTE: Do *not* add several layouts for the same *scale* and *theme* if you intend to have operations that go across them.
The division of the layout into main and branch lines is done later when assigning modules to different lines.
