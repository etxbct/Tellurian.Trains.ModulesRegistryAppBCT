Welcome to the *open source* project for creating a registry for *model railway modules*. You find more to read in the [WIKI](https://github.com/tellurianinteractive/Tellurian.Trains.ModulesRegistryApp/wiki).

## Goal
The project's man goal is to create an application 
for maintaning data about *model railway modules* with the following qualities:
- Handle all important aspects of module data to enable to plan meetings.
- Support for managing modules in any scale in any standard.
- Available to any user within the module railwayers community.
- Different levens of user access for flexible data management.
- Support any language that is required by the module railwayers community.
- Available as a cloud application.

## Status August 2021
All functions for managing modules are now inplace, including:
* Managing your *modules*, *stations* and *station freight customers*.
* Transfer of module *ownership* - part or whole - to other person or group.
* Manage *groups* and *members* and member's *modules*, *stations* and *station freight customers*.
* Administrators can manage *meetings*, *regions*, *cargo types*, *module standards* and *module gables*.
* Meeting organisers can now add persons as *participants* and add their modules to a *layout*
* Users can now add themselves as *meeting particpant* and and their modules to a layout.
* Domains now change group visibiliy for groups within same domain. FREMO is a domain.
* More information is now publicly visible.
* Help texts for most forms with recommendation how to enter data.
* Supported languages: English, German, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian.

## Planned work
You can now see the planned work under [Projects](https://github.com/tellurianinteractive/Tellurian.Trains.ModulesRegistryApp/projects/2). 

## Timetable Planning App
The *Timetable Planning App* takes meeting planning further.

In the *Module Registry*, you finalize the planing by defining the streches 
between the layout's stations and the modules on these stretches in the order they appear.
From that, with the *Timetable Planning App* you create timetabled lines, 
plan the trains, plan the circulation of rolling stock, make driver duties and can print the documentation needed for all participants.

The Timetable Planning App is also an [open source project](https://github.com/tellurianinteractive/Tellurian.Trains.TimetablePlanningApp) and is under development.
