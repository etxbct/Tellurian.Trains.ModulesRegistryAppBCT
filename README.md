# Module Registry App
Welcome to the *open source* project for creating a registry for *model railway modules*
and a *module meeting* magagement tool.

The basic idea is to centralise data storage while decentralise data management. 
You find the application [here](https://moduleregistry.azurewebsites.net/). 
It is updated quite frequently, so check out the [release notes](https://github.com/tellurianinteractive/Tellurian.Trains.ModulesRegistryApp/blob/master/RELEASENOTES.md).

You need an invitation to create an account and log in. Contact your [country administrator](https://moduleregistry.azurewebsites.net/contacts). 
Read more in the [WIKI](https://github.com/tellurianinteractive/Tellurian.Trains.ModulesRegistryApp/wiki) and
follow the [discussions](https://github.com/tellurianinteractive/Tellurian.Trains.ModulesRegistryApp/discussions) about new features and other related things.

#### Goal
The project's man goal is to create an application 
for maintaning data about *model railway modules* with the following qualities:
- Handle all important aspects of module data to enable to plan meetings.
- Support for managing modules in any scale in any standard.
- Available to any user within the module railwayers community.
- Different levels of user access for flexible data management.
- Support any language that is required by the module railwayers community.
- Available as a cloud application.

#### Status December 2022
All functions for managing modules are now in place, including:
* Managing **your modules, stations and station freight customers**.
* **Transfer of module ownership** - part or whole - to other person or group.
* **Manage groups and group members**, including group member's modules, stations and station freight customers.
* Administrators can **manage meetings, external stations, regions, cargo types, module standards and module end profiles**.
* Users and meeting organisers can **register a participant** and add modules to a layout.
* **Create waybills** for individual stations at a meeting. 
* Domains **change group visibiliy** for groups within same domain for better collaboration. FREMO is such a domain.
* **User management** for administrators and regular users.
* **Help texts** for most forms with recommendation how to enter data.
* **Supported languages:**
  * in user interface: **English, German, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian**.
  * Cargo types in four additional languages: **French, Dutch, Italian and Polish**.
  * Waybills for **cross border freights are bi-language**, with sender and receiver information in respective language.
